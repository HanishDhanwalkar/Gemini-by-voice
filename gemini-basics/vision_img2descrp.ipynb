      "Mittens had so much fun with the mouse that she forgot all about the other things she was supposed to be doing. She didn't eat her food, and she didn't take a nap. She just kept playing with the mouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Mittens' owner came home and found her still playing with the mouse. The owner was very angry and told Mittens to get off the computer. Mittens was very sad, but she knew that she had been bad. She slunk off to her bed and took a long nap.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, Mittens woke up and decided to be a good cat. She ate her food, took a nap, and played with her toys. She didn't even think about the computer mouse.\n",

      "Mittens learned her lesson that day. She learned that it's important to listen to her owner and that there are other things to do besides play with the computer mouse. But most importantly, she learned that she is a very loved cat.\n"
